      <article>
        <p>
          Hello! Im Ramon Silva, a 29-year-old software developer with five
          years dedicated to the tech market. My roots are in Brasília, but my
          journey led me to live for 18 wonderful years on the Piauí coast, an
          experience that shaped my perspective. I hold a degree in Information
          Systems and have been working with development since my first
          internships, through freelance projects, and into my current position.
        </p>
        <p>
          My great passion is turning ideas into reality through code,
          developing robust solutions for both web and mobile. Im proficient in
          the JavaScript ecosystem, with a special focus on Angular and mobile
          development with Ionic.
        </p>
        <p>
          Throughout my career, I ve built extensive experience, including the
          migration of microservices to more efficient architectures, the
          creation of complex and responsive layouts, and the development of
          innovative solutions for major players in the financial sector. This
          background has given me a comprehensive vision and the ability to work
          on various fronts of a software project.
        </p>
        <p>
          When Im not immersed in the world of code, youll likely find me
          binge-watching my favorite anime, exploring new worlds in video games,
          or following a good football match.
        </p>
